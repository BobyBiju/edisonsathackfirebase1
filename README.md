## Project Description

Firebase provides set of hosting services like NoSQL and real-time databases, social authentication, and notifications, etc . Team Edison presents <b>Joli App</b> . Joli is an app build on Flutter and we have used Firebase as the database too . So dear Employees , just create a new account in the app and put a full stop to your local job hunts and dear employers start seizing the best damn workers to meet your tasks .

*We intend to solve unemployment and ensure the supply of expert employees.

*We have developed an app where people can get in touch with skilled workers to get their chores and tasks done .

*We will be providing the unemployed with access to regular work to support themselves in this pandemic hit economy.

*We would be covering the marketgap between employers and employees at an affordable rate for both parties.



## Notable Features

In this project we have done the complete read , write and update operations of Firebase.

In our app people could register themselves up as a laborer or an emoloyer where employees give up their necessary info and employers can :
 
 --phone them , discuss work through our app
  
 --see their position in google maps with respect to the registered location of employees' chosen region to work.
  
 --pay them through razorpay.
  
  and much more in the future!!!!
